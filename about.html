        Jotted was born out of a need for learning and the frustration of racing thoughts scrambling to find a home. Because both of these work very well together, I decided to create a safe place for myself to teach and learn at the same time, while maybe taming my thoughts a little in the process.

        My name is Abel Shinabery and I'm currently a full-time student at Texas State University in San Marcos, TX. I also find time to work in Austin and in between exercise my passion for web development.

        You may have noticed that this site is relatively new and has some improvements to be made. I'm working as hard as I can to get it up to snuff, but would love you to hear your suggestions if you have any. I'm currently working on a tag system using Jekyll and working on learning JavaScript to make my website more dynamic. Let me know what you think <a href="/contact.html">here</a>.
