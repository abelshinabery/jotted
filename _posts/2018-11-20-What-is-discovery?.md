title: What is discovery?
---

Discovery has had a special place in my heart for most of my life now. I don’t really have a lot of memories from my childhood, but I do remember that I always loved to explore and ask questions. It’s how I learned about emotions -- what they mean and how they interact with each other, unraveling the world around me.

Unfortunately, procrastination has been with me just as long. I like to think that there is a delicate dance between the two forces and it’s what makes life so sweet when you find that pocket of understanding. Ultimately, that’s what I would like this section to be about. Balance.
